		<h1>Michael Guerrero</h1>
		<h2>Update: Week of 9/23</h2>
		<p>Met with Dr.Hegedus about the project and learnt more about what we are going to build. He gave us details about the
		project and the required specifications to power everything from an oxygen nebulizer to charging a phone.</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 10/14</h2>
		<p>Visited the Insititue of Energy Conversion to get a better sense of the project we are making. Also met with the team to
		work on calculating what parts would give us the proper output.</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 10/21</h2>
		<p>Met with Dr.Martin outside of class to discuss the project in more detail and gained insight about the wi-fi
		capabilities along with the software side of things.</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 10/28</h2>
		<p>Responsible for maintaing the backend of the website and updating the html files. Helped organize the team's GitHub
		to make it easier to keep track of files and commits. Sent out a list of the parts we needed, for ordering.</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 11/4</h2>
		<p>Pushed the new commits to the website. Assisted in looking up the parts necessary to build this device.</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 11/11</h2>
		<p>Pushed the new commits to the website. Emailed Dr. Hegedus a list of parts we want to order, waiting for his approval before we actually order them.</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 11/18</h2>
		<p>Pushed the new commits to the website. Parts list approved and sent to Tom to be ordered.</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 11/25</h2>
		<p>Thanksgiving Break</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 12/2</h2>
		<p>Pushed the new commits to the website. Helped finalize presentation. Practiced presentation and revised.</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 12/9</h2>
		<p>Pushed the new commits to the website. Worked on the midterm report, using the feedback from the presentation.</p>

		<h2>Update: Winter Break</h2>
		<p>Setup server to host our site, since the previous school server we were using has since been shutdown.</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 2/10</h2>
		<p>Talked to TAs and Dr. Martin about improving various aspects of the charge controller.
		    Installed necessary libraries for the M5STack in arduino.</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 2/17</h2>
		<p>Updated security of the server. Added code for a basic display on the Stack measuring two voltages. </p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 2/24</h2>
		<p>Ordered more parts. Added a third measurement to the staack for current.</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 3/2</h2>
		<p>Fully fleshed-out our design for the charge controller.</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 3/9- Week of 3/23</h2>
		<p>Coronavirus Shutdown</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 3/30 (Emergence of Covid-19)</h2>
		<p>Discussed plans moving forward with group and professors</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 4/6</h2>
		<p>Discussed some design changes with Dr. Hegedus</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 4/13</h2>
		<p>Ordered P-MOSFET and battery, removed our current measurement to try and display the current battery life of the Stack.</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 4/20</h2>
		<p>Adjusted our voltage measurement algorithm to get more accurate results. Also added a reveserse voltage divider formula
	            to find the source voltage entering the MOSFET to change the pwm of the resulting gate voltage coming out of the Stack.</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 4/27</h2>
		<p>Implemented MOSFET to charge controller, played around with values on the stack to increase accuracy of our data. Also started
		    implementing Adafruit.io to send data to the cloud to make it more accessible for consumers.</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 5/4</h2>
		<p>Pushed the new commits to the website. Started to setup api requests to adafruit.io to pull the data from the stack
		   and display on our website.</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 5/11</h2>
 		<p>Pushed the new commits to the website. Prepared final presentation and presented it.</p>

		<h2>Update: Week of 5/18</h2>
 		<p>Pushed the new commits to the website. Wrapped up paper along with finalizing everything else. </p>
