		<h1>Michael Figura</h1>
			<h2>Update: Week of 9/23</h2>
			<p>
			Sept. 23 - Met with Dr. Hegedus to discuss project specifics and the goals for the semester/year.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 10/7</h2>
			<p>
			Oct. 13 - Started running our website on the server and set up the base design of the website.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 10/14</h2>
			<p>
			Oct. 17 - Traveled to the Institute of Energy Conversion in order to gain an understanding of the hardware
				utilized in the project and analyze similar models and prototypes.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 10/21</h2>
			<p>
			Oct. 21 - Spoke with Dr. Martin about the software side of things, which is the area that Michael G. and I
				will mostly be working on. He provided us with helpful information and some possible software
				components for use (MP5 stack and ESP32).
			<br>
			Oct. 22-24 - Met with group and began calculating specs for the equipment necessary for the project.
				 This project relies on precise measurements for each part so pre-design is very important.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 10/28</h2>
			<p>
			Oct. 28 - Spoke with Dr. Hegedus about our calculations and parts we arrived at. He gave us feedback and
				adjustments as well as precise measurements from documents involving solar panels. It is clear that
				we will need more precise calculations before parts get ordered.
			<br>
			Oct. 29 - Formatted the website to be more visually appealing. Michael G. and I will be responsible for maintaining
				 the backend of the website and the github throughout the semester/year.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 11/4</h2>
			<p>
			Nov. 4-10 - Spent the week completing the final semantics on paper and confirming this information.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 11/11</h2>
			<p>
			Nov. 13 - Finalized parts list and sent to Dr. Hegedus for confirmation.
			<br>
			Nov. 15 - Began researching how to properly develop and build charge controller.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 11/18</h2>
			<p>
			Nov. 18 - Began researching how to develop and implement charge controller, started calculations for charge controller.
			<br>
			Nov. 21 - Sent out a finalized parts list for ordering so we can begin moving our calculations over to hardware.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 11/25</h2>
			<p>
			All Week - Thanksgiving Break
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 12/02</h2>
			<p>
			Dec. 1 - Charge controller schematic complete, now need to transfer over to actual hardware.
			<br>
			Dec. 1-4 - Spent the week putting everything together and preparing for the midterm presentation.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 12/09</h2>
			<p>
			Dec. 9-11 - Spent the week putting everything together and preparing the final paper as well as other necessary submissions.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Winter Break</h2>
			<p>
			Migrated server over to Mike's old laptop to run from here on out.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 02/10</h2>
			<p>
			Feb. 11 - Made multiple improvements to the design in the charge controller with the TAs.
			<br>
			Feb. 13 - Went over design changes with Professor Martin.
			<br>
			Feb. 14 - Added and got familiar with necessary libraries for the M5Stack.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 02/17</h2>
			<p>
			Feb. 18-21 - Implemented code that allowed the stack to read voltage values.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 02/24</h2>
			<p>
			Feb. 24-26 - Enabled M5Stack to read current.
			<br>
			Feb. 27 - Ordered most of the parts necessary for the changes made so far.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 03/02</h2>
			<p>
			Mar. 2-5 - Fully completed charge controller design.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 03/09-03/23</h2>
			<p>
			COVID Shutdown.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 03/30</h2>
			<p>
			Mar. 31 - Apr. 2 - Discussed how to proceed with professors, TAs, and group members.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 04/06</h2>
			<p>
			Apr. 4 - Discussed design changes we would have to make (due to limited resources) with Dr. Hegedus.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 04/13</h2>
			<p>
			Apr. 14 - Ordered P-MOSFET and Battery.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 04/20</h2>
			<p>
			Apr. 20 - Added MOSFET to charge controller circuit, started testing of charge controller.
			<br>
			Apr. 21-23 - Got bulk of code dealing with voltage reading done. Made formulas for voltage much more accurate as well as developed a formula to find the source voltage (of MOSFET).
			<br>
			Apr. 24-26 - Completed the PWM code by linking the source voltage found to the gate voltage coming out of the stack.
			</p>
			<h2>Update: Week of 04/27</h2>
			<p>
