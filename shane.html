		<h2>Week of 9/23:</h2>
		<p> Set 23 - Got in touch with Dr. Hegedus to discuss off-grid solar design</p>
		<p> Oct 13 - Ran website on server and began base design</p>

		<h2>Week of 10/14:</h2>
		<p> Oct 17 - Went to visit the IEC, Institute of Energy Conservation, building where we will be doing most of our project
		design.Got to look at potential solar panel we would be able to use. Also were able to look over larger scale prototypes of solar off grid systems.</p>

		<h2>Week of 10/21:</h2>
		<p> Oct 21 - Talked to Professor Martin in his office regarding parts he could provide us. Gave us a possible
		microcontroller to use ( M5 stack,ESP32)</p>
		<p> Oct 22-24 - Met with group and began calculating specs for the equipment necessary.This is when we decided the
		Solar modules wattage output along with voltage that can adequately keep up with our medical device load.</p>
		<p> Oct 28 - Talked to Professor Hegedus about initial design ideas and got feedback on adjustments to some numbers.
		Provided a document to give us exact likely outputs for solar panels that factor in cloudy days etc.</p>

		<h2>Week of 10/28:</h2>
		<p> Oct 28 - Sent out a parts list to Dr. Cotton, will meet with him and Dr. Hegedus to discuss the design for our system</p>
		<p> Oct 31 - Met with Professor Hegedus to show him our design and gain feedback on our calculations. We determined that a total
		energy demand of 180 Watts assuming the device can be on for 4 hours throughout the day. Along with 21.4 amp/hr per day running
		through the battery at a system efficiency of 70%. We calculated a worst case for our system not having power for 3 days(too many
		clouds) to show that a 100 Amp hour battery is needed. All these calculations lead use to need 7.2 amps of current required from the
	 	array and 72 Watts. With this knowledge we will most likely look for 2 12 volt arrays in parallel to meet this need. </p>

		<h2>Week of 11/04:</h2>
		<p> Nov 6 - Looked online for component prices for our current design. Tried to find the best quality for a reasonable price especially
			for the battery, as it is the most expensive part. </p>
		<p> Nov 8 - Found websites to look through PV panel data sheets to determine the required size of the two panels to meet our required 
			current for the system. Started to realize the large expense buying two panels would be. Only looked for panels with larger solar
			cells out of a recommendation from Dr. Hegedus. </p>

		<h2>Week of 11/11:</h2>
		<p> Nov 12 - Researched the difference between MPPT and PWM charge controllers. Came to the conclusion we had more knowledge to
			construct a PWM charge controller. </p>
		<p> Nov 14 - Researched the different types of MOSFETS needed to interact with pwm systems to safely charge the battery. Found that 
			using a N channel MOSFET is useful for controlling the power flow while P channel MOSFET is useful for driving the load. Wanted
			to ensure the MOSFETS had low RDS(on) values. </p>

		<h2>Week of 11/18:</h2>
		<p> Nov 18 - Reworked calculations based off a suggestion from Professor Hegedus to make the system smaller. This will allow us to use
		M55 Arco solar module provided by the IEC. We changed the target energy demand from 180 Watts down to 60 Watts. This changed the daily amp hours
		down to 7.12 amp/hr per day. We would also adjust our battery capacity down to 50 ah. </p>
		<p> Nov 21 - Sent out a final parts list to Tom Lum including pieces need for the charge controller and the M5 stack. </p>
		
		<h2>Week of 11/25:</h2>
			<p> Thanksgiving break </p>
			
		<h2>Week of 12/2: </h2>
		<p> Dec 2 - Finished first schematic of the charge controller provided basic resistor and capacitors numbers subject to change. </p>
		<p> Dec 3-5 - Worked on preparing and practicing my portion of the presentation on December 5th at 7 PM. </p>
			
		<h2>Week of 12/9: </h2>
		<p> Dec 9-11 - Gathered all the information collected throughout the semester to put into our final paper. Revised the document before
			submission. </p>
		<h2>Winter Break</h2>
		<p>Conducted research on methods to inporve the safety and quality of our charge controller. First design of the charge controller
			was put onto a breadboard. </p>

		<h2>Week of 2/10: </h2>
		<p>Feb 11 - Met with TA's and Martin to update them on our modifications to the charge controller </p>
		<p>Feb 12 - I showed our Charge Controller design to Professor Hegedus where he looked over the basic structure of our design. </p>
		
		<h2>Week of 2/17: </h2>
		<p>Feb 17 - There were updates to our design as we looked up specific vlaues we needed in our circuit this included Vgs for our P mosfet
			and the Rds of our diode to limit power loss. We started outting together a parts list. </p>

		<h2>Week of 2/24: </h2>
		<p>Feb 25 - Met with Professor Hegedus again to discuss my component findings. He told me everything checked out and the circuit was looking good.
			He suggest increasing the resistor values for our voltage divider to mitigate power loss. </p>
		<p>Feb 27 - Got diodes and a pcb breadboard form Evans along with resistors we need. </p>

		<h2>Week of 3/2: </h2>
		<p>March 3 - Reached final design of our chrage controller and put it on our standard breadboard. </p>
		
		<h2>Week of 3/9 to 3/23: </h2>
		<p>Covid lockdown and spring break </p>
		
		<h2>Week of 3/30: </h2>
		<p>March 30 - Regrouped after the shutdown. Filled out the spring contingency plan for the professor to discuss
			changes in our design plan. </p>
		<p>March 31 - Talked with the TA about some of our worries and the supplies we would need being a harware based 
			project </p>
		
		<h2>Week of 4/6: </h2>
		<p> April 7 - Talked to Dr. Hegedus about design changes and when he would be available to pick up tools and materials. </p>
		
		<h2>Week of 4/13: </h2>
		<p> April 13 - Ordered P type MOSFETS and a battery from Tom </p>
		<p> April 15 - Picked up the solar panel and many other supplies from the IEC with the help of Dr. Hegedus. </p>
		
		<h2>Week of 4/20: </h2>
		<p> April 23 - Implemented the MOSFET into our charge controller, began simple tests using a power supply and 
			multimeter to ensure the circuit was preforming properly.</p>
		<h2>Week of 4/27: </h2>
		<p> April 28 - Tested the circuit with the solar panel to see the ammount of current coming out of the MOSFET
			compared to the amount of current coming out of the panel.</p>
		<p> May 1 - Implemented our finished pwm design with the stack to test the ability of the circuit to turn on
			and keep the gate to source voltage as close to 10 Volts as possible.</p>

		<h2>Week of 5/4: </h2>
		<p> May 7 - Tested our final charge controller design on the first breadboard using the battery and current sensor.
			Unfortunetly this test had an accidental slip when on of the battery terminals clipped a resistor by accidnet 
			and shorted the M5stack and current sensor. We were forced to take them out of the circuit. </p>
		<p> May 9 - Finished soldering our charge controller onto the pcb board. Leaving pins for the M5 stack to connect 
			setting up the terminal block for the battery and solar panel. </p>
		<p> May 10 - Picked up an extra M5 stack from Professor Martin </p>
	
		<h2>Week of 5/11: </h2>
		<p> May 11 - Preformed a final test with all of our components on a sunny day. Added it to the presentation. </p>
		<p> May 12 - Put the final touches on our presentation. </p>
		<p> May 14 - Practiced our slides then gave the final presentation to the Professors and TA's. </p>
